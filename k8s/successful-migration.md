I've successfully migrated all services from Docker Compose to
  Kubernetes. Here's what was created:

  âœ… Created Kubernetes Resources:

  1. Databases:
    - postgres/postgres-statefulset.yaml - PostgreSQL StatefulSet
  with persistent storage
    - redis/redis-main.yaml - Main Redis for event bus
    - redis/redis-celery.yaml - Dedicated Redis for Celery
  2. Core Services:
    - api/deployment.yaml - Updated API service deployment
    - storage/storage-service.yaml - Storage service with PVC
    - storage/storage-worker.yaml - Storage worker deployment
  3. Task Processing:
    - celery/celery-worker.yaml - Celery worker deployment
    - executors/executor-deployment.yaml - Executor services (1 & 2)
    - docker-proxy/docker-proxy-daemonset.yaml - Docker proxy as
  DaemonSet
  4. Monitoring:
    - flower/flower-deployment.yaml - Complete Flower deployment
  5. Configuration:
    - config/configmap.yaml - Application and nginx configurations
    - config/secrets.yaml - Template secrets (replace in production)
    - namespace.yaml - Namespace definition
  6. Infrastructure:
    - Updated kustomization.yaml to include all resources
    - Proper security contexts, resource limits, and health checks
    - Persistent volume claims for stateful services

  Key Differences from Docker Compose:

  - Used StatefulSet for PostgreSQL (better for databases)
  - DaemonSet for Docker proxy (runs on every node)
  - Separate PVCs for persistent storage
  - Proper Kubernetes security contexts
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration
  - Service discovery using Kubernetes DNS

  Next Steps:

  1. Replace placeholder values in secrets.yaml with real
  credentials
  2. Update image references with actual ECR registry URLs
  3. Apply with: kubectl apply -k k8s/base/
  4. Consider using Helm or operators for production deployments
