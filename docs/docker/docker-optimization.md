Docker Image Optimization Strategy

  1. Multi-Stage Builds

  - Current: Most services use single-stage builds
  - Optimization: Separate build dependencies from
  runtime
    - Build stage: Install compilers, dev tools, build
  packages
    - Runtime stage: Copy only built artifacts, no build
   tools
  - Benefit: Reduces final image size by 30-50%

  2. Virtual Environments

  - Current: Packages installed globally in container
  - Optimization: Use Python venv for better isolation
  - Benefit: Cleaner dependency management, easier to
  copy between stages

  3. Layer Caching Optimization

  - Current: Some services copy all files before
  installing dependencies
  - Optimization:
    - Copy requirements first, then install
    - Copy source code last
  - Benefit: Rebuilds are faster when only code changes

  4. Selective File Copying

  - Current: COPY api/ /app/api/ copies everything
  - Optimization: Copy only needed files
    - Skip __pycache__, tests, docs
    - Use .dockerignore file
  - Benefit: Smaller images, no unnecessary files

  5. Shared Base Image Enhancement

  - Current: Base image includes all dependencies
  - Optimization:
    - Multi-stage base image
    - Separate build tools from runtime
    - Externalize health check script
  - Benefit: All services benefit from optimized base

  6. Security Improvements

  - Current: Good (already using non-root user)
  - Enhancement:
    - Set PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 to prevent .pyc
  files
    - Use --chown in COPY to avoid extra layers
    - Add security labels

  7. Size Reduction Techniques

  - Remove apt cache: rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  - Use --no-cache-dir with pip
  - Combine RUN commands where sensible
  - Use slim base images (already doing)

  Example Impact:

  Before optimization:
  - API Service: ~400MB
  - With all dependencies and build tools

  After optimization:
  - API Service: ~250MB
  - Only runtime dependencies
  - No build artifacts
  - No documentation/tests

  8. Production Configuration

  Creating docker-compose.prod.yml with:
  - Resource limits (CPU, memory)
  - Restart policies
  - Health check tuning
  - Read-only root filesystem where possible
  - Security options
