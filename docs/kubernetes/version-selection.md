### Version Comparison

## Implementation

### Create Cluster with Specific Version
```bash
# Single-node cluster with K8s 1.32.5
kind create cluster --name crucible-learn --image kindest/node:v1.32.5

# Verify version
kubectl version --short
```

### Check Available kind Images
```bash
# See what's available locally
docker images kindest/node

# Pull specific version
docker pull kindest/node:v1.32.5
```

## Why Not Latest (1.33)?

While 1.33 is stable, for learning purposes:
- 1.32 has more patches (more stable)
- Better tool/documentation support
- Fewer edge cases to debug
- Still modern with all features you need

## Core Concepts Are Version-Agnostic

The fundamental concepts you're learning haven't changed significantly:

```yaml
# This Deployment works the same from 1.25 to 1.33
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
```

## Conclusion

For your learning journey starting in July 2025, **Kubernetes 1.32.5** offers the best balance of:
- Modern features
