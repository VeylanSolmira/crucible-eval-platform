I've successfully created a comprehensive
  documentation system for the Crucible Platform:

  ✅ What we built:

  1. Documentation Routes (/docs)
    - Home page with overview
    - Dynamic routes for all markdown files
    - Support for nested documentation structure
  2. Unified Markdown Rendering
    - Uses existing react-markdown (no
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML!)
    - Syntax highlighting with
  react-syntax-highlighter
    - Mermaid diagram support for
  architecture/sequence diagrams
    - Reuses gray-matter for frontmatter parsing
  3. Navigation System
    - Sidebar with collapsible sections
    - Search functionality (UI ready, implementation
  pending)
    - Breadcrumb navigation
    - Previous/Next links
  4. Documentation Sources
    - /docs - Platform documentation
    - /frontend/docs - Frontend-specific docs
    - /docs/api - API documentation
  5. Example Documentation
    - Architecture overview with mermaid diagrams
    - API endpoints reference
    - Quick start guide

  🏗️ Architecture & Sequence Diagrams

  I've added support for Mermaid diagrams which
  render:
  - Architecture diagrams: Show system components and
  their relationships
  - Sequence diagrams: Show interactions between
  components over time
  - Flow charts: Show process flows and decision trees

  Example in the platform overview doc shows both
  types!

  🔒 Security

  - No dangerouslySetInnerHTML in the docs system
  - React Markdown sanitizes content by default
  - XSS-safe rendering

  📦 Dependencies

  We unified around existing packages:
  - react-markdown - Safe markdown rendering
  - gray-matter - Frontmatter parsing (already used by
   slides)
  - react-syntax-highlighter - Code highlighting
  - mermaid - Diagram rendering (new addition)

  The documentation is now fully integrated into the
  platform at /docs with a clean, professional design
  that matches the rest of the application!

  My Thoughts on Content Organization

  You raise excellent points about content curation.
  Here's my recommendation:

  1. README.md Files

  - Keep: Root README, main docs README, architecture
  overview READMEs
  - Skip: Service-specific READMEs that just say "This
   is the X service"
  - Transform: Some READMEs could become proper
  documentation pages

  2. Slides Integration

  I think Option C (Hybrid) makes the most sense:
  - Keep /slides for presentation mode (with
  Reveal.js)
  - Include slide content in /docs/presentations as
  readable documents
  - This way you get both: presentation capability AND
   searchable documentation

  Benefits:
  - Slides become searchable in docs
  - Can read slides without presentation mode
  - Single source of truth for content
  - Cross-linking between docs and slides

  3. Content Hierarchy

  /docs
    /getting-started     # Quick wins for new users
    /guides             # Task-oriented guides
    /architecture       # System design and decisions
    /api               # API reference
    /deployment        # Operations guides
    /development       # Contributing and internals
    /presentations     # Slide content in article
  format
    /security          # Security documentation

  4. Smart Exclusions

  // In docs.ts
  const SMART_EXCLUDES = [
    '**/node_modules/**',
    '**/.git/**',
    '**/dist/**',
    '**/build/**',

    // Selectively exclude READMEs
    'services/*/README.md',  // Service READMEs
    'demos/*/README.md',     // Demo READMEs

    // But include valuable ones
    '!docs/**/README.md',    // Keep docs READMEs
    '!README.md',            // Keep root
  ]

  The key is making the content discoverable and
  useful rather than just complete. Quality over
  quantity!

  Yes, currently you need to manually insert wiki
   links into the markdown files using the [[Page
   Name]] syntax. There's no automatic topic
  extraction or link generation yet.

  The current system:
  1. Manual linking: You write [[Docker 
  Security]] in your markdown
  2. Link resolution: The system finds the
  matching document
  3. Backlinks: Automatically tracks which
  documents reference each other
  4. Visual indicators: Shows if the target page
  exists or not

  For automatic topic extraction, we could add:

  1. Entity Recognition

  // Example: Auto-detect common terms
  const commonTopics = ['Docker', 'Kubernetes',
  'Security', 'API', 'Container'];
  const autoLinkContent = (content: string) => {
    commonTopics.forEach(topic => {
      // Replace mentions with wiki links (if not
   already linked)
      content = content.replace(
        new RegExp(`\\b(${topic})\\b(?!\\]\\])`,
  'g'),
        '[[$1]]'
      );
    });
    return content;
  };

  2. Smart Suggestions

  - Analyze document content for key concepts
  - Suggest potential wiki links based on:
    - Existing document titles
    - Frequently mentioned terms
    - Technical keywords (gVisor, containerd,
  etc.)

  3. AI-Powered Linking (future)

  - Use embeddings to find semantically related
  documents
  - Auto-suggest cross-references based on
  content similarity
  - Generate "See also" sections

  Would you like me to implement basic automatic
  topic detection as a starting point? It could
  identify document titles mentioned in text and
  suggest converting them to wiki links.L
