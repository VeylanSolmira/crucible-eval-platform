# Pragmatic Security Decisions

## The Dilemma

We face a classic engineering trade-off:
- **Security Best Practices**: Never run containers as root
- **Practical Reality**: Docker socket access requires elevated privileges
- **Time Constraint**: Building for a demo/interview, not production

## Options Considered

### 1. The "Perfect" Solution
- Microservices architecture
- Docker socket proxy
- Kubernetes Jobs
- Full RBAC

**Time Investment**: Days to weeks
**Complexity**: High
**Demo Value**: Questionable

### 2. The "Good Enough" Solution
- Monolithic application
- Run as root when needed
- Clear documentation
- Show upgrade path

**Time Investment**: Hours
**Complexity**: Low
**Demo Value**: High (shows pragmatism)

## Our Decision: Pragmatic Monolith

### Why This Makes Sense

1. **Interview Context**: Demonstrating over-engineering is worse than pragmatic solutions
2. **Time Value**: Better to have working features than perfect architecture
3. **Clear Documentation**: Shows we understand the trade-offs
4. **Upgrade Path**: Can demonstrate knowledge without implementation

### Implementation

```dockerfile
# Pragmatic approach - run as root when needed
USER root  # With comment explaining why

# In production, would use:
# - Kubernetes Jobs for execution
# - Separate execution service
# - No direct Docker socket access
```

### What We'll Document

1. **Current State**: "Uses root for Docker access in demo"
2. **Security Implications**: Clear explanation of risks
3. **Production Path**: How to properly secure it
4. **Trade-off Rationale**: Why we made this choice

## Lessons from Previous Over-Engineering

We've learned that:
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Working code > perfect architecture
- Time-boxed projects need pragmatic decisions
- Documentation can show knowledge without implementation

## The Professional Approach

Real senior engineers:
1. Understand ideal architecture
2. Make pragmatic decisions based on constraints
3. Document trade-offs clearly
4. Plan for future improvements

This demonstrates maturity and real-world experience better than over-engineered solutions.

## Next Steps

1. Use root user in Dockerfile where needed
2. Get Docker execution working
3. Document security considerations
4. Include "Production Considerations" section
5. Focus on core METR requirements
