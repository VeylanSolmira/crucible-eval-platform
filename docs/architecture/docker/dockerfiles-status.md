# Dockerfile Status

## Overview

The Dockerfiles in this project are **placeholders** for future microservice deployment. Currently, all components run as part of the monolithic platform.

## Current Status

### Active Components (with placeholder Dockerfiles)
- `execution-engine/Dockerfile` - Placeholder (used as library)
- `event-bus/Dockerfile` - Placeholder (used as library)
- `security-scanner/Dockerfile` - Placeholder (integrated into platform)

### Future Services
- `future-services/api-gateway/Dockerfile` - Not implemented
- `future-services/monitoring/Dockerfile` - Not implemented
- `future-services/queue/Dockerfile` - Not implemented
- `future-services/storage/Dockerfile` - Not implemented

## Running the Platform

Currently, run the monolithic platform directly:
```bash
cd src/platform
python app.py
```

## Future Microservices

When ready to deploy as microservices:

1. Implement `main.py` for each service with FastAPI
2. Update Dockerfiles with proper CMD statements
3. Update `requirements.txt` with needed dependencies
4. Use docker-compose to orchestrate services

## Why Keep Placeholder Dockerfiles?

1. **Documentation** - Shows intended architecture
2. **Planning** - Helps think about service boundaries
3. **Migration Path** - Ready to implement when needed
4. **Best Practice** - Each service should be containerizable
