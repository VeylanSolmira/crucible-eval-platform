# OpenAPI Generation Fix - Comprehensive Solution

## Current Issues

1. **Multiple Services Generate OpenAPI**: 
   - `api/microservices_gateway.py` - Main API
   - `storage-service/app.py` - Storage endpoints  
   - `executor-service/app.py` - Executor endpoints

2. **Read-Only Container Problem**:
   - Services try to export OpenAPI on startup
   - Containers run with `read_only: true` for security
   - Writes to filesystem fail silently

3. **CI/CD Complexity**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow assumes single API
   - Frontend type generation only uses main API spec
   - No consolidated view of all service APIs

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Remove Runtime Generation

Remove all startup OpenAPI export code from services. This code fails in read-only containers and adds unnecessary runtime complexity.

### 2. Create Export Scripts for Each Service

Create dedicated export scripts similar to the main API:

```bash
api/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py          # Exists
storage-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py   # Create
executor-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py  # Create
```

### 3. Update CI/CD Workflow

Modify `.github/workflows/generate-openapi-spec.yml` to handle all services:

```yaml
- name: Generate OpenAPI specs from all services
  run: |
    # Main API
    python api/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py
    
    # Storage Service
    python storage-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py
    
    # Executor Service
    python executor-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py
```

### 4. Enable Service-to-Service Communication

Each service can generate client code for calling other services:

```bash
# Storage service can generate client for API service
storage-service/scripts/generate-api-client.sh

# API service can generate client for storage service  
api/scripts/generate-storage-client.sh
```

### 5. Frontend Type Generation

Frontend is just one consumer that needs types from multiple services:

```bash
frontend/scripts/generate-all-types.sh
```

This enables:
- Type-safe API calls from frontend
- Autocomplete in IDEs
- Compile-time error checking

### 5. Keep HTTP Endpoints

Keep the `/openapi.yaml` endpoints in each service for:
- Local development convenience
- API documentation access
- Third-party tool integration

These work fine since they don't write to filesystem.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Storage Service Export Script

`storage-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Export OpenAPI specification from Storage Service."""

import json
import yaml
import sys
from pathlib import Path

sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))

from storage_service.app import app

openapi_schema = app.openapi()

json_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "openapi.json"
yaml_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "openapi.yaml"

with open(json_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(openapi_schema, f, indent=2)
    f.write("\n")

with open(yaml_path, "w") as f:
    yaml.dump(openapi_schema, f, default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False)

print(f"âœ… Exported Storage Service OpenAPI spec")
```

### Step 2: Create Executor Service Export Script

Similar structure for `executor-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py`

### Step 3: Remove Startup Export Code

Remove the `@app.on_event("startup")` export functions from:
- storage-service/app.py
- Any other services attempting runtime export

### Step 4: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
- name: Generate all OpenAPI specs
  run: |
    # Export all specs
    python api/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py
    python storage-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py
    python executor-service/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py
    
    # Validate all specs exist
    for service in api storage-service executor-service; do
      test -f $service/openapi.yaml || exit 1
      test -f $service/openapi.json || exit 1
    done

- name: Upload all OpenAPI specs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: openapi-specs
    path: |
      */openapi.yaml
      */openapi.json
```

### Step 5: Update Frontend Type Generation

Create composite type generation that includes all services:

```json
// frontend/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate-types": "npm run generate-types:api && npm run generate-types:storage && npm run generate-types:executor",
    "generate-types:api": "openapi-typescript ../api/openapi.yaml -o ./types/generated/api.ts",
    "generate-types:storage": "openapi-typescript ../storage-service/openapi.yaml -o ./types/generated/storage.ts",
    "generate-types:executor": "openapi-typescript ../executor-service/openapi.yaml -o ./types/generated/executor.ts"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Works with Read-Only Containers**: No runtime filesystem writes
2. **CI/CD Friendly**: All specs generated during build
3. **Service Interoperability**: Any service can generate type-safe clients for other services
4. **External API Consumers**: Third parties can generate clients in any language
5. **Testing Tools**: Postman, Insomnia can import specs directly
6. **Documentation**: Auto-generated, always up-to-date API docs
7. **Maintainable**: Each service owns its spec generation
8. **Backwards Compatible**: HTTP endpoints still work

## Use Cases

### Internal Service Communication
- API service calls Storage service with type-safe client
- Executor service reports status to Storage service
- Services can validate requests/responses against contracts

### External Consumers
- Mobile apps generate Swift/Kotlin clients
- Partner integrations use generated Python/Go clients
- CLI tools built with type safety

### Development Tools
- API mocking for frontend development
- Contract testing between services
- Auto-generated test cases from specs

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Add export scripts (non-breaking)
2. **Phase 2**: Update CI/CD to use scripts
3. **Phase 3**: Remove runtime export code
4. **Phase 4**: Update frontend type generation

## Testing

After implementation, verify:
1. All services start without errors in read-only mode
2. CI/CD generates all specs successfully
3. Frontend builds with types from all services
4. HTTP endpoints still serve specs
