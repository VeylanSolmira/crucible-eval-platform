# Shared Contracts Migration Checklist

## Overview
This checklist tracks the migration to shared contracts across all services in the metr-eval-platform. The goal is to establish a single source of truth for types, statuses, and constants used across the distributed system.

## Contract Categories

### DEFINITELY SHARED/CORE ‚úÖ
These are fundamental domain concepts that MUST be consistent across all services:
- **EvaluationStatus enum** - The core state machine (queued, running, completed, failed)
- **Event names/channels** - Inter-service communication contracts
- **Event payload schemas** - What data flows between services
- **Resource limits** - Security-critical constraints (memory, CPU, output size)
- **Base error format** - Consistent error structure for debugging
- **Evaluation ID format** - How we identify evaluations everywhere

### DEFINITELY SERVICE-OWNED ‚ùå
These should remain within individual services:
- **Service health check details** - Each service's internal health metrics
- **Internal configuration** - Service-specific settings
- **Implementation details** - How each service accomplishes its work
- **Service-specific error messages** - Detailed internal errors
- **Database models** - Storage service owns the schema
- **Docker implementation** - Executor service owns container details

### AMBIGUOUS/NEEDS ANALYSIS ü§î
These could go either way and need discussion:
- **EvaluationRequest full model** - Core fields shared, extensions service-specific?
- **Timeout values** - System-wide policy or service-configurable?
- **QueueStatusResponse** - Queue internals or system-wide visibility?
- **Language/Engine enums** - Shared for validation or executor-owned?
- **Retry policies** - System-wide or per-service?
- **API response formats** - Standardize or let services decide?

## Migration Focus: SHARED/CORE Only
We'll focus on the definitely shared items first, then revisit ambiguous items.

## Streamlined Implementation Plan for CORE Contracts

### Step 1: Create Shared Structure
- [x] Create `/shared/` directory
- [x] Create `/shared/types/` directory  
- [x] Create `/shared/constants/` directory
- [x] Create `/shared/docker/` directory
- [x] Create `/shared/generated/` directory
- [x] Move `base.Dockerfile` to `/shared/docker/`

### Step 2: Define Core Contracts
- [x] Create `shared/types/evaluation-status.yaml` with status enum
- [x] Create `shared/types/event-contracts.yaml` with event schemas
- [x] Create `shared/constants/limits.yaml` with security limits
- [x] Create `shared/constants/events.yaml` with channel names

### Step 3: Update Python Services to Use Enum
Focus on status enum first (highest impact):
- [x] Update `api/microservices_gateway.py` - Add enum, update models
- [x] Export new OpenAPI spec: `python api/scripts/export-openapi-spec.py`
- [x] Regenerate frontend types: `cd frontend && npm run generate-types`
- [x] Update frontend polling to use generated enum values

### Step 4: Verify Fix
- [x] Test evaluation submission
- [x] Verify status transitions work
- [x] Confirm execution time is back to ~3 seconds

### Step 5: Expand to Other Services ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Once working in API/Frontend:
- [x] Apply pattern to queue-service
- [x] Apply pattern to storage-service
- [x] Apply pattern to executor-service (returns execution results, not evaluation statuses)
- [x] Apply pattern to storage-worker
- [x] Apply pattern to queue-worker (routes executor results, doesn't use evaluation statuses)

## Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory

### Status Values Inventory
- [ ] Search all Python files for status assignments/comparisons
  - [ ] `grep -r "status.*=" --include="*.py" .`
  - [ ] `grep -r "status.*==" --include="*.py" .`
  - [ ] Document every unique status value found
- [ ] Search all TypeScript files for status checks
  - [ ] `grep -r "status" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" frontend/`
  - [ ] Document all status string literals
- [ ] Search database migrations for status columns
  - [ ] Check `storage/database/models.py`
  - [ ] Check migration files
- [ ] Create final list of canonical status values

    max_cpu_cores: 0.5
  ```
- [ ] ‚úÖ Create `shared/constants/events.yaml` (INTER-SERVICE CONTRACTS)
  ```yaml
  channels:
    evaluation_queued: "evaluation:queued"
    evaluation_started: "evaluation:started"  
    evaluation_completed: "evaluation:completed"
