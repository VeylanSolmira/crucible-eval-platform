monitoring
    test/inspect cloudwatch infrastructure
testing
    get all current tests integrated in run_tests.py to 100% -- about half fail
    bring tests to next level: assess what that precisely means, key unit tests for each component, key integration, percentage coverage, description of level after this
kubernetes migration
    explore putting each service on its own t2.micro -- cost implications (partially interested just from architectural experience)
security
    we haven't been doing so much with this recently because needing to get infrastructure up to higher levels of quality just for evaluation and testing. need to start circling back to this, e.g. the download v. evaluate distinction
    attack scenarios from 5-day-metr
infrastructure
    probably need to get a vpc/private subnets going for security considerations

interview prep
    revisit questions and work on schedule? differnet protocols to hone my knowledge of the platform
