- [ ] End of day: Note progress, plan tomorrow

## Not Doing This Week

These are documented as "future enhancements":
- Authentication system (comprehensive design in SECURITY.md, implementation in Phase 2)
- Kubernetes deployment (Docker Compose sufficient for demo, k8s manifests as future work)
- 90% test coverage (focus on critical integration tests)
- Multi-tenant support (architecture supports it, document the design)

## Key Messages for Demo

1. **Production-Ready Architecture**
   - Microservices with clear boundaries
   - Distributed task processing with Celery
   - Multi-backend storage system
   - Real-time monitoring

2. **Engineering Excellence**
   - Zero-downtime migration strategy
   - Type-safe frontend/backend integration
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Security-first design

3. **Platform Maturity**
   - Wiki-style documentation
   - One-command deployment
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Clean, maintainable code

4. **Security Awareness**
   - "We've implemented security headers and rate limiting"
   - "Authentication is fully designed in SECURITY.md"
   - "The architecture supports multi-tenant isolation"
   - "Here's how JWT auth would integrate..." [show diagram]

## Demo Talking Points for Missing Features

When asked about authentication:
> "We prioritized core platform architecture for this demo. Authentication is fully designed in our SECURITY.md document, including JWT flows, RBAC model, and API key management. The API layer is built to accept authentication middleware - it would plug in here [show code]. We can walk through the design if you'd like."

When asked about Kubernetes:
> "We're using Docker Compose for this demo, but the architecture is Kubernetes-ready. Each service has health checks, follows 12-factor principles, and we've documented the k8s deployment strategy. Docker Compose gives us faster iteration during development."

Remember: It's better to have fewer features working perfectly than many features working poorly. Focus on polish and professionalism.
