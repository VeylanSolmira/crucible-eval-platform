  - [ ] Monitor log shipping metrics

### 4. Long-term gVisor AMI Solution

#### 4.1 Design Post-Bootstrap Configuration
- [ ] Create systemd service for gVisor configuration
  - [ ] Runs after kubelet.service
  - [ ] Idempotent configuration script
  - [ ] Proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Update AMI build process
  - [ ] Include systemd service in custom AMI
  - [ ] Add configuration verification
  - [ ] Test with multiple EKS versions

#### 4.2 Document Custom AMI Process
- [ ] Create comprehensive AMI build guide
- [ ] Document testing procedures
- [ ] Establish AMI update cadence
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### 5. Technical Debt Reduction

#### 5.1 Fix Celery Worker Readiness Probe
- [ ] Replace broken `celery inspect ping` exec probe
  - [ ] Add HTTP health endpoints (/healthz and /readyz)
  - [ ] Run small FastAPI server alongside celery worker
  - [ ] Update Kubernetes deployment to use HTTP probes
  - [ ] Follow pattern from storage_worker implementation

#### 5.2 Fix GitHub Actions Health Check Warning
- [ ] Investigate "Health check failed (non-critical)" warning in deploy workflow
  - [ ] Workflow uses curl to check health endpoint inside pod
  - [ ] Celery worker image doesn't have curl installed
  - [ ] Either add curl to base image or skip curl check for certain services
  - [ ] Warning is spurious - pod is actually healthy (1/1 Ready)

#### 5.3 Remove Inter-Service Health Checks (from Week 8)
- [ ] Audit remaining services for health check anti-patterns
  - [ ] Storage service
  - [ ] Storage worker
  - [ ] Dispatcher
  - [ ] Frontend

  - [ ] Try/catch with retries
  - [ ] Circuit breakers where appropriate
  - [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting

#### 5.2 Standardize Logging Infrastructure
- [ ] Replace print statements with proper logging
  - [ ] API service
  - [ ] Dispatcher service
  - [ ] Storage worker
  - [ ] Test infrastructure
- [ ] Implement structured logging
  - [ ] JSON format for production
  - [ ] Include trace IDs
  - [ ] Proper log levels

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

#### 6.1 Implement Adaptive Timeout Testing
- [ ] Create sophisticated timeout validation for tests
  - [ ] Consider cluster load when asserting on execution times
  - [ ] Account for pod scheduling delays and preemption
  - [ ] Implement load-aware timeout assertions
  - [ ] Add cluster resource metrics to test context
- [ ] Update test_evaluation_timeout to be less brittle
  - [ ] Remove hard-coded 15-second limit
  - [ ] Base expectations on actual cluster conditions
  - [ ] Consider retry attempts in timing calculations

  - [ ] Performance benchmarks
  - [ ] Security boundary tests

  - [ ] Run security tests
  - [ ] Performance regression tests

#### 6.3 Chaos Testing for gVisor

  - [ ] Node replacement scenarios
- [ ] Document failure modes and recovery

## Success Criteria üéØ

1. **gVisor Operational**
   - All evaluation pods run with gVisor runtime
   - No performance degradation > 20%
   - Security boundaries validated

2. **Platform Stability**
   - Exit code tracking fixed
   - Log shipping reliability > 99.9%
   - Health checks follow best practices

3. **Documentation Complete**
   - gVisor runbook created
   - AMI build process documented
   - Security boundaries documented

## Dependencies & Blockers üöß

- gVisor DaemonSet requires careful security review
- Custom AMI process needs iteration time
- Log shipping changes may affect existing monitoring

## Notes üìù

- DaemonSet approach is tactical; custom AMI is strategic
- Consider using Bottlerocket OS in future (has better runtime support)
- gVisor adds ~50-100ms overhead per container start

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Monitoring Service Architecture Design
- [x] Identified fundamental design flaws in dispatcher log fetching
  - Dispatcher was trying to fetch logs when Kubernetes job completed
  - Created race conditions between job completion and pod cleanup
  - Made evaluation success dependent on log availability
  - Violated single responsibility principle

#### Key Issues Discovered:
1. **Double Race Condition**
   - Race between Job completion and Pod cleanup by cleanup controller
   - Race between Pod deletion and Loki log ingestion by Fluent Bit
   - Dispatcher interpreted "no logs in Loki yet" as "evaluation failed"

2. **Architectural Smell**
   - Logs are already handled by Fluent Bit ‚Üí Loki pipeline
   - Dispatcher duplicating log collection responsibility
   - Bundling logs with completion events created unnecessary coupling

3. **Fix Implemented**
   - Removed exit code checking from log retrieval
   - Trust Kubernetes job status as source of truth
   - Made logs best-effort in completion events
   - Job succeeded = evaluation succeeded, regardless of log availability

### Monitoring Service Proposal
Based on the issues discovered, the monitoring service should:
- Own all log aggregation and retrieval
- Query Loki asynchronously after events
- Provide unified log API for all services
- Handle log shipping coordination with Fluent Bit
- Monitor log pipeline health

This separation would eliminate the race conditions and properly separate concerns.
