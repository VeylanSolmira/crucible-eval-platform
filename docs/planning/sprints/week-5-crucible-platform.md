# Week 5 - Crucible Platform Sprint Plan

## Overview
With 5 days remaining in Week 5, this plan focuses on high-priority items organized by success probability tiers. Our main goals are Kubernetes migration, getting tests to 100%, creating tiered demo scenarios, and documentation polish.

## Tier 1: Must Complete (90% success rate) - Days 1-2

### 1. Test Suite Completion ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Get all current tests in run_tests.py to 100%
  - [x] Fix failing tests (went from 63% to 100% passing)
  - [x] Update tests to match current architecture
  - [x] Remove tests for deprecated features
  - [ ] Add missing test coverage for new features
- [x] Document test results and coverage metrics

**Final Results: 87 tests passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped = 100% of runnable tests passing!**

**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed JSONB compatibility between PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Fixed SQLite connection pooling parameter issues
- Added missing `code_hash` fields to all test data
- Fixed async/sync mismatch in flexible manager tests
- Updated database backend to handle SQLite vs PostgreSQL differences

**Test Breakdown:**
- ✅ API Evaluation Request Validation - 6/6 passed
- ✅ Celery Retry Configuration - 6/6 passed
- ✅ Storage - Memory Backend - 19/19 passed
- ✅ Storage - File Backend - 24/24 passed
- ✅ Storage - Database Backend - 24/24 passed
- ✅ Storage - Flexible Manager - 8/8 passed
- ⚠️ PostgreSQL Operations - 2 skipped (need PostgreSQL test DB)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Test Failures**: If tests are too broken, focus on critical path tests only
2. **Kubernetes Complexity**: Start with simplest possible configs, add features incrementally
3. **Demo Issues**: Always have manual fallback for each automated demo
4. **Time Constraints**: Strictly timeboxed - move to next tier even if current isn't perfect

## Notes
- Focus on demonstrable progress over perfection
- Document what doesn't work as "known issues"
- Keep a running list of "future improvements" for items we can't complete
- Daily standups to assess progress and adjust priorities
