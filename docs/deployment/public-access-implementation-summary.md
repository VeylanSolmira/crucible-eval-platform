# Public Access Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Infrastructure as Code for DNS and IPs

- **Elastic IPs**: Each deployment color (blue/green) gets a stable IP address
- **Route 53 Support**: Optional DNS management through AWS
- **Flexible DNS**: Supports both AWS-managed and external DNS providers
- **Blue-Green Switching**: Easy traffic switching via `active_deployment_color` variable

### 2. Security Implementation

- **IP Whitelisting**: `allowed_web_ips` variable for gradual access control
- **Security Groups**: Updated to support HTTP/HTTPS with IP restrictions
- **Phase 2 Security**: Ready for HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

### 3. Nginx Configuration

#### Current: Host-Based Nginx (Quick Setup)
- Nginx installed via userdata on EC2
- Auto-configured when `domain_name` is set
- Rate limiting included
- Security headers configured
- Ready for SSL with certbot

#### Future: Containerized Nginx (Better Architecture)
- Complete docker-compose.nginx.yml ready
- Nginx configs for container deployment
- SSL automation with certbot container
- Migration path documented

### 4. Documentation

- **Public Access Setup Guide**: Step-by-step implementation
- **Container Deployment Strategies**: Analysis of approaches
- **Kubernetes vs Managed Services**: Architectural deep dive
- **Migration Path**: Clear path from host to container Nginx

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Update Terraform Variables

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
domain_name = "crucible.veylan.dev"
allowed_web_ips = [
  "YOUR.IP.HERE/32"  # Start with just your IP
]
```

### 2. Apply Infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
tofu plan
tofu apply
```

This will:
- Create Elastic IPs for stable addressing
- Update security groups for web access
- Configure Nginx on new instances

### 3. Configure DNS

Get the Elastic IP from output:
```bash
tofu output elastic_ips
```

Then either:
- **Vercel**: Add A record for crucible → elastic-ip
- **Route 53**: Set create_route53_zone = true

### 4. Obtain SSL Certificate

Once DNS propagates:
```bash
ssh ubuntu@<elastic-ip>
sudo certbot --nginx -d crucible.veylan.dev
```

### 5. Test Access

From whitelisted IP:
```bash
curl https://crucible.veylan.dev/api/status
```

## Architecture Decision

We've prepared for both approaches:

1. **Immediate**: Nginx on host (simpler, faster)
2. **Future**: Nginx in container (cleaner, portable)

The infrastructure supports both, allowing gradual migration.

## Security Posture

- ✅ IP whitelisting ready
- ✅ Rate limiting configured
- ✅ Security headers prepared
- ✅ HTTPS ready (pending cert)
- ✅ Infrastructure as code
- ✅ Easy rollback via blue-green

## Summary

We've built a complete public access solution that:
- Maintains security through IP whitelisting
- Provides stable IPs via Elastic IPs
- Supports both AWS and external DNS
- Includes both immediate and long-term Nginx strategies
- Follows infrastructure as code principles
- Enables zero-downtime deployments

The platform is ready for secure public access with a clear migration path for future improvements.
