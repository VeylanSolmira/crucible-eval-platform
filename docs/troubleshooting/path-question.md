Great question! Let me explain the difference
  between these two import statements:

  import path from 'path' vs import * as path 
  from 'path'

  1. Default Import (what we had):

  import path from 'path'
  - This tries to import the default export from
  the 'path' module
  - In ES6 modules, you'd export it like: export 
  default { join, resolve, ... }
  - Node.js built-in modules like 'path' don't
  have default exports - they use CommonJS

  2. Namespace Import (what we changed to):

  import * as path from 'path'
  - This imports all exports from the module and
  puts them in a namespace object called path
  - Works with CommonJS modules (like Node.js
  built-ins)
  - You access methods like: path.join(),
  path.resolve(), etc.

  Why the Error?

  Node.js built-in modules like 'path' are
  CommonJS modules that look like:
  // Inside Node's path module (simplified)
  module.exports = {
    join: function() { ... },
    resolve: function() { ... },
    dirname: function() { ... }
  }

  TypeScript needs to know how to handle this.
  The error said:
  "Module 'path' can only be default-imported 
  using the 'esModuleInterop' flag"

  This means TypeScript wants us to either:
  1. Use import * as path (which we did)
  2. Or enable esModuleInterop in tsconfig.json,
  which adds compatibility shims

  What We're Actually Using It For:

  In the file, we use path for:
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..',
  base, file);

  This joins directory segments into a proper
  file path, handling different OS path
  separators (/ vs .

  The namespace import is the more explicit and
  compatible way to import CommonJS modules in
  TypeScript!
