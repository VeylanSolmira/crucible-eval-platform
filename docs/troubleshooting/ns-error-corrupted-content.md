  was blocked due to MIME type (“text/html”) mismatch 
  (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff).

⏺ The problem is clear now! Flower's static files at /static/ are
   being intercepted by nginx and not properly proxied. The MIME
  type mismatch and NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT errors indicate
  that nginx is returning HTML error pages instead of the actual
  CSS/JS files.

  I need to add a location block to properly proxy Flower's
  static files:

⏺ Update(nginx/conf.d/crucible.conf)
  ⎿  Updated nginx/conf.d/crucible.conf with 13 additions        
       109            # Basic auth handled by Flower itself
       110            proxy_set_header Authorization 
     $http_authori
             zation;
       111            proxy_pass_header Authorization;
       112 +          
       113 +          # Rewrite Location headers for redirects
       114 +          proxy_redirect http://flower:5555/ 
     /flower/;
       115        }
       116        
       117 +      # Flower static files (CSS, JS, etc)
       118 +      location /static/ {
       119 +          proxy_pass http://flower:5555/static/;
       120 +          proxy_set_header Host $host;
       121 +          
       122 +          # Cache static assets
       123 +          expires 1h;
       124 +          add_header Cache-Control "public";
       125 +      }
       126 +      
       127        # Frontend (Next.js app)
       128        location / {
       129            proxy_pass http://crucible-frontend:3000;

⏺ Now restart nginx to apply the changes:

⏺ Bash(docker restart crucible-nginx)
  ⎿  crucible-nginx

> Can you give me a primer on that error? I really don't have 
  much understanding ont hat

⏺ Understanding the NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT Error

  What happened:

  1. Browser Request: Your browser tried to load CSS/JS files for
   Flower:
    - https://localhost/static/css/bootstrap.min.css
    - https://localhost/static/js/jquery-3.6.4.min.js
    - etc.
  2. Wrong Content Type: Instead of getting CSS/JS files, nginx
  returned HTML (probably a 404 error page)
  3. Security Protection: Modern browsers have a security feature
   called MIME type checking:
    - When you request a .css file, the browser expects
  Content-Type: text/css
    - When you request a .js file, the browser expects
  Content-Type: application/javascript
    - But nginx was returning Content-Type: text/html (an error
  page)
  4. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff: This security header tells
  the browser "don't guess the content type, trust what I tell
  you"
    - We set this in nginx: add_header X-Content-Type-Options 
  "nosniff"
    - It prevents browsers from "sniffing" content and guessing
  wrong
    - Good for security, but strict about mismatches
  5. NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT: Firefox's way of saying "this
  file claims to be CSS/JS but it's actually HTML, I'm blocking
  it for safety"

  Why it happened:

  Before my fix, when you accessed /flower/, the HTML loaded but
  tried to fetch:
  - /static/css/bootstrap.min.css
  - But nginx didn't know /static/ belonged to Flower
  - So it hit the catch-all / location block
  - Which tried to serve it from the frontend
  - Frontend didn't have these files, returned 404 HTML
  - Browser blocked the HTML masquerading as CSS/JS

  The fix:

  Added a specific location block for /static/ to proxy to
  Flower's static files, so now the correct CSS/JS files are
  served with the correct content types.

  FOUND IT! Line 137-141 has a regex pattern that matches ALL
  .css and .js files and proxies them to the frontend! This is
  taking precedence over the /static/ location block.

  This regex location ~* 
  \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ matches
   any URL ending with .css or .js, so:
  - /static/css/flower.css matches this regex
  - It gets proxied to the frontend (which doesn't have these
  files)
  - Frontend returns 404 HTML
  - Browser blocks it due to MIME type mismatch

  I need to make the Flower static location more specific or
  remove the overly broad regex:
