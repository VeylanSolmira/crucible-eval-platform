Can you write up a primer on "The issue is clear: 
  we're calling asyncio.run() from
     within a thread that's already part of an async
    application. This creates a new event loop which
    conflicts with the existing one." I think I could 
  learn a lot in that context

⏺ Understanding the asyncio.run() Event Loop Conflict

  This is a great learning opportunity! Let me explain
   this common Python async/await pitfall in detail.

  The Problem Context

  In our executor service, we had:
  1. A FastAPI application running with uvicorn (which
   creates and manages an event loop)
  2. A Docker events listener running in a separate
  thread
  3. When a Docker event occurred, we tried to call
  asyncio.run() from that thread

  What is an Event Loop?

  An event loop is the core of Python's async/await
  system. Think of it as a scheduler that:
  - Manages all async tasks (coroutines)
  - Decides which task runs when
  - Handles I/O operations without blocking
  - Coordinates between different async operations

  # When you start an async application, an event loop
   is created:
  async def main():
      await some_async_function()

  # This creates a NEW event loop and runs main() in 
  it
  asyncio.run(main())

  The Conflict Explained

  Here's what was happening in our code:

  # 1. FastAPI/uvicorn starts with its own event loop
  # Event Loop A is created and running

  # 2. In a separate thread, we receive Docker events
  def _process_events_sync(filters):
      for event in docker_client.events():
          if event['Action'] == 'die':
              # 3. We try to create ANOTHER event 
  loop!

  asyncio.run(_handle_container_completion(...))  # ❌
   Creates Event Loop B!

  The error occurs because:
  - asyncio.run() tries to create a new event loop
  - But the coroutine _handle_container_completion
  uses resources (like redis_client) that are bound to
   the original event loop
  - Python detects this conflict and raises an error

  Visual Representation

  Main Thread (FastAPI)          Docker Events Thread
  │                              │
  ├─ Event Loop A                │
  │  ├─ FastAPI handlers         │
  │  ├─ Redis connections        ├─ Sync Docker events
  │  └─ Other async tasks        │
  │                              ├─ Tries
  asyncio.run()
  │                              │  └─ Event Loop B ❌
  │                              │     └─ Tries to use
   Redis
  │                              │        from Loop A!

  The Solution Pattern

  Instead of creating a new event loop, we need to
  submit work to the existing one:

  # 1. Get reference to the main event loop
  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

  # 2. Create a queue for communication between 
  threads
  event_queue = asyncio.Queue()

  # 3. In the sync thread, submit work to the main 
  loop
  def _process_events_sync(event_queue, loop):
      for event in docker_client.events():
          if event['Action'] == 'die':
              # Schedule coroutine in the EXISTING 
  event loop
              asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
                  event_queue.put((eval_id,
  container)),
                  loop
              )

  # 4. In the main async context, process the queue
  async def process_docker_events():
      while True:
          eval_id, container = await event_queue.get()
          await _handle_container_completion(eval_id,
  container)

  Key Concepts

  1. One Event Loop Per Thread: Each thread can have
  at most one running event loop
  2. asyncio.run() Creates New Loops: Always creates a
   fresh event loop, which conflicts with existing
  ones
  3. run_coroutine_threadsafe(): The safe way to
  submit async work from a sync thread to an existing
  event loop
  4. Event Loop Affinity: Async resources (like
  database connections) are tied to the event loop
  that created them

  Common Scenarios Where This Happens

  1. Webhooks in threads: Processing webhooks in
  background threads
  2. File watchers: Monitoring file system changes in
  threads
  3. Message queues: Consuming from queues in separate
   threads
  4. Signal handlers: Handling OS signals that need to
   trigger async operations

  Best Practices

  1. Avoid mixing sync and async code when possible
  2. Use queues for thread-to-async communication
  3. Get the loop reference early and pass it to
  threads
  4. Use asyncio.to_thread() for running sync code
  from async context
  5. Never call asyncio.run() inside an
  already-running async application

  Debugging Tips

  When you see "attached to a different loop" errors:
  1. Check if you're calling asyncio.run() somewhere
  2. Look for thread boundaries in your code
  3. Verify you're using run_coroutine_threadsafe()
  for cross-thread async calls
  4. Ensure resources are created in the same event
  loop that uses them

  This pattern is crucial for building robust async
  applications that need to interact with synchronous
  APIs or handle events from external sources!
