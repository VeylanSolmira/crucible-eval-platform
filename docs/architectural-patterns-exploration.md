# Architectural Patterns Exploration

## Starting from First Principles

### The Core Problem
We need to evaluate AI models safely. This means:
1. **Isolation**: Models can't escape or affect other evaluations
2. **Observability**: We need to see what models are doing in real-time
3. **Scalability**: Handle many evaluations concurrently
4. **Reproducibility**: Results must be consistent and verifiable

### Deriving the Architecture

#### Step 1: Isolation Requirements
**Question**: How do we prevent a potentially dangerous AI from escaping?

**Options**:
1. **Process isolation**: Run each evaluation in separate OS process
   - ✅ Simple to implement
   - ❌ Limited isolation (shared kernel, filesystem)
   
2. **Virtual Machines**: Full VM per evaluation
   - ✅ Strong isolation
   - ❌ Heavy resource usage, slow startup
   
3. **Containers + Security Layers**: Docker/K8s with additional hardening
   - ✅ Good balance of isolation and efficiency
   - ✅ Industry standard, lots of tooling
   - ❌ Still shares kernel (but can use gVisor/Kata)

**Decision**: Containers with defense-in-depth approach

#### Step 2: Orchestration Pattern
**Question**: How do we manage many isolated evaluation environments?

**Options**:
1. **Manual orchestration**: Scripts that spin up/down containers
   - ✅ Full control
   - ❌ Doesn't scale, error-prone
   
2. **Container orchestration (Kubernetes)**:
   - ✅ Battle-tested at scale
   - ✅ Self-healing, declarative
   - ✅ Rich ecosystem (monitoring, security)
   - ❌ Complexity overhead

3. **Serverless (Lambda/Cloud Run)**:
   - ✅ No infrastructure management
   - ❌ Time limits, less control over environment
   - ❌ Harder to implement custom security

**Decision**: Kubernetes for flexibility and control

#### Step 3: Communication Pattern
**Question**: How do components talk to each other securely?

**Common Patterns**:
1. **Monolithic**: Everything in one service
   - ✅ Simple deployment
   - ❌ Can't scale components independently
   - ❌ Single point of failure

2. **Microservices with REST**:
   - ✅ Clear boundaries, independent scaling
   - ✅ Language agnostic
   - ❌ Network overhead, complexity

3. **Event-driven (Pub/Sub)**:
   - ✅ Loose coupling, resilient
   - ✅ Good for async workflows
   - ❌ Debugging harder, eventual consistency

**Decision**: Hybrid - REST for synchronous ops, events for async workflows

#### Step 4: Data Flow Pattern
**Question**: How does work flow through the system?

**Options**:
1. **Request/Response**: Client waits for evaluation to complete
   - ✅ Simple mental model
   - ❌ Long-running operations timeout
   - ❌ Poor user experience

2. **Queue-based with Workers**:
   - ✅ Handles long-running tasks well
   - ✅ Natural load balancing
   - ✅ Fault tolerance (retry failed tasks)
   - ❌ More moving parts

**Decision**: Queue-based for reliability and scale

## The Resulting Architecture Pattern

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │────▶│ API Gateway │────▶│ Task Queue  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘
                            │                    │
                            ▼                    ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
                    │  WebSocket  │     │ Orchestrator│
                    │   Server    │     └──────┬──────┘
                    └─────────────┘            │
                                               ▼
                                      ┌─────────────────┐
                                      │   Kubernetes    │
                                      │  ┌───────────┐  │
                                      │  │ Eval Pod  │  │
                                      │  └───────────┘  │
                                      └─────────────────┘
```

This is essentially a **Task Queue + Container Orchestration** pattern, common in:
- CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitLab CI)
- ML platforms (Kubeflow, MLflow)
- Security scanning (Container scanning, pentesting platforms)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Async Task Processing
**Pattern**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Commands (submit eval) go through task queue
- Queries (get status) hit API directly
- Updates streamed via WebSocket

**Why**: Separates concerns, allows independent scaling

### 2. Sidecar Pattern for Monitoring
**Pattern**: Each eval pod has monitoring sidecar
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     Evaluation Pod      │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌───────┐ │
│  │  Model  │ │Monitor│ │
│  │Container│ │Sidecar│ │
│  └─────────┘ └───────┘ │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Why**: Separation of concerns, can't be disabled by model

### 3. Gateway Pattern
**Pattern**: Single entry point for all external requests

**Benefits**:
- Centralized auth/rate limiting
- API versioning
- Request routing
- Protocol translation (HTTP to gRPC internally)

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Where**: Between services, especially external deps

**Why**: Prevents cascade failures, graceful degradation

## Questions to Deepen Understanding

1. **What happens if the task queue fills up?**
   - Consider: Backpressure, priority queues, queue monitoring

2. **How do we handle partial failures?**
   - Consider: Saga pattern, compensating transactions

3. **What about multi-region deployment?**
   - Consider: Data residency, latency, consistency

4. **How would you add real-time collaboration?**
   - Consider: CRDTs, operational transformation, presence

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Distributed Monolith**: Microservices that can't deploy independently
2. **Chatty Services**: Too many small network calls
3. **Shared Database**: Services sharing DB couples them
4. **Sync All The Things**: Making everything synchronous

## Learning Exercise

Try to identify these patterns in popular platforms:
- **GitHub Actions**: Where do you see task queues? Container orchestration?
- **Google Colab**: How might they isolate notebooks?
- **OpenAI Playground**: What patterns enable safe model interaction?

## Next Steps
1. Implement a minimal version with just task queue
2. Add container orchestration
3. Layer in security controls
4. Add monitoring/observability

Each step should be functional and teachable!
