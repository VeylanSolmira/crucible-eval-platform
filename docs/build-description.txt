We have openapi.yaml to maintain current and accurate interfaces between services.

We have individual python scripts for the services that need to provide this: api-service, storate-service, and executor-service, I believe.

We have a master script that runs all of them: safe-generate-types.js (this should probably be renamed to remove safe prefix? the safety was that it had fallback types which seem to defeat the purpose of the openapi interface definitions, i.e. we prefer to fail clearly and quickly)

this is sort of primarily for prod/cicd but we want an integrated solution, obviously

we're working to test in prod, but want it to work in dev first as similarly as possible to reduce cognitive load/solution drift.

for prod
	we have the deploy-compose.yml workflow which invokes the generate-openapi-spec which shoudl make available the openapi files
	we haven't test this workflow yet as we're working on the dev component...
for dev
	we have a single start script: start-platform.sh which has a call to generate-all-openapi-specs (this is also called by generate-openapi-spec workflow). much of the time this is what we're using in dev, but not always. I believe even this script is currently failing

	sometimes, though we want to be rebuild individual containers like docker compose build crucible-fronted and we'd like that to work

	sometimes, also, we might want to run npm run build or equivalent for hte absolute fasting checking on build errors

	ideally, our solution would allow us to do all of these different approaches

current status
	works: ./scripts/generate-all-openapi-specs.sh
	fails: docker compose build crucible-frontend --no-cache

I want you to first deeply analyze the problem then give me honest proposals if we can meet all my desired execution modes in dev and what that would require. feel free to include anything else you think is relevant
