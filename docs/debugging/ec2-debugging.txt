      1. List all frontend images with their tags:
         docker images | grep -E 'REPOSITORY|frontend'

      2. Check what image the running container is using:
         docker inspect crucible-platform-frontend
      --format='{{.Config.Image}}'

      3. Check what the docker-compose.yml expects:
         grep -A5 'crucible-frontend:'
      /home/ubuntu/crucible/docker-compose.yml | grep
      image

      The GitHub Actions should have pushed images with
      tags like:
      - frontend-3adffbfd4d278945836a190d54f488fbf2edd39d
       (git SHA)

⏺ If the images don't match, we may need to:
  1. Manually pull the specific image tag that was built
  2. Or check if the GitHub Actions actually pushed the
  frontend image successfully

  You can also check the GitHub Actions log to see what
  image tags were pushed.
