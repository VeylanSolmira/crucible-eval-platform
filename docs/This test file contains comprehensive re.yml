This test file contains comprehensive resilience tests
   for the platform. It tests how well the system
  handles service failures and recoveries. Here's what
  it tests:

  Test Suite Overview

  1. Service Restart Test (lines 33-106)

  - Submits a long-running evaluation (10 seconds)
  - Restarts the queue-worker service mid-execution
  - Verifies the evaluation still completes successfully
  - Tests that work isn't lost during service restarts

  2. Celery Worker Failure Test (lines 108-180)

  - Stops the Celery worker completely
  - Submits an evaluation (should queue up)
  - Verifies it stays in "queued" status
  - Restarts the worker
  - Confirms the queued work gets processed

  3. Storage Service Failure Test (lines 182-259)

  - Submits and completes an evaluation
  - Stops the storage service
  - Attempts to retrieve the evaluation (tests graceful
  failure)
  - Restarts storage service
  - Verifies data persistence and integrity

  4. Network Partition Test (lines 262-303)

  - Basic test for network connectivity
  - Currently simplified (comment notes more complex
  network manipulation needed)
  - Tests basic end-to-end functionality

  Why It's Commented Out

  Looking at the test configuration in run_tests.py,
  it's commented out likely because:

  1. Requires Docker Compose commands - Tests
  restart/stop/start services
  2. Potentially destructive - Stops running services
  during tests
  3. Timing sensitive - Has hardcoded sleep times that
  might be flaky
  4. Environment dependent - Assumes specific
  docker-compose setup

  Key Features

  - Tests real failure scenarios
  - Verifies data persistence across restarts
  - Ensures queued work isn't lost
  - Checks graceful degradation
  - Saves detailed results to JSON

  This is a valuable test suite for production
  readiness, ensuring the platform can handle common
  failure scenarios like service crashes, restarts, and
  temporary outages.
