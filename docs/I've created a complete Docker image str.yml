I've created a complete Docker image structure for the
   executor service:

  1. Directory Structure (/docker/)

  docker/
  ├── README.md                 # Overview and security
  architecture
  ├── executor-base/           # Minimal Python executor
  │   ├── Dockerfile
  │   └── README.md
  └── executor-ml/            # ML-enabled executor
      ├── Dockerfile
      ├── README.md
      ├── requirements.txt
      └── test_ml_executor.py

  2. Base Executor (executor-base)

  - Extracts the hardcoded python:3.11-slim
  - Adds non-root user for security
  - Minimal attack surface
  - ~150MB size

  3. ML Executor (executor-ml)

  - Multi-stage build for security
  - PyTorch 2.0.1 (CPU-only)
  - Transformers 4.35.0
  - Offline mode enforced
  - ~1.3GB size

  4. Configuration System

  - Created executor_config.py for image selection
  - Supports different resource limits per image type
  - Environment variable overrides
  - ML workloads get 2GB RAM and 1 CPU

  5. Demo Files

  - hello_world_ml.py - Simple ML demo
  - test_ml_executor.py - Test suite for ML image

  Key Security Features:

  - Multi-stage builds (no build tools in production)
  - Non-root execution
  - No package managers in final images
  - Offline mode for ML (no model downloads)
  - All existing runtime restrictions maintained

  The executor service can now support multiple
  specialized images while maintaining the strong
  security model through the Docker proxy.
