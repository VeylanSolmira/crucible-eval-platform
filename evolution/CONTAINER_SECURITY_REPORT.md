## Executive Summary

Tested **7 attack scenarios** across **2 execution engines**.

### Security Scores by Engine:
- **SUBPROCESS**: ⚠️ 71.4% secure (5/7 scenarios blocked)
- **DOCKER**: ❌ 42.9% secure (3/7 scenarios blocked)

## Critical Findings

### ❌ Critical Vulnerabilities Found:
- **docker**: Basic Container Escape Attempts
- **docker**: Privileged Operations Test

## Detailed Results by Attack Scenario

### Basic Container Escape Attempts
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Common container escape vectors that should be blocked

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ✅ SECURE | 3 attacks blocked |
| docker | ❌ VULNERABLE | 1 attacks succeeded |

### Privileged Operations Test
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Attempts to perform operations that require elevated privileges

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ✅ SECURE | 4 attacks blocked |
| docker | ❌ VULNERABLE | 1 attacks succeeded |

### Network Isolation Bypass
**Threat Level**: HIGH
**Description**: Attempts to bypass network isolation and exfiltrate data

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ❌ VULNERABLE | 3 attacks succeeded |
| docker | ❌ VULNERABLE | 1 attacks succeeded |

### Filesystem Boundary Escape
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Attempts to access or modify host filesystem

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ✅ SECURE | 4 attacks blocked |
| docker | ✅ SECURE | 4 attacks blocked |

### Resource Exhaustion / DoS
**Threat Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Attempts to exhaust system resources

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ⚠️ UNKNOWN |  |
| docker | ⚠️ UNKNOWN |  |

### Kernel Exploit Vectors
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Tests for common kernel exploit entry points

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ✅ SECURE | 5 attacks blocked |
| docker | ✅ SECURE | 5 attacks blocked |

### Timing and Side Channel Attacks
**Threat Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Tests for information leakage through side channels

| Engine | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| subprocess | ✅ SECURE | 1 attacks blocked |
| docker | ✅ SECURE | 1 attacks blocked |

## Security Recommendations

1. **NEVER use subprocess in production** - It provides no isolation
2. **Docker needs additional hardening** - Use security options like:
   - `--security-opt no-new-privileges`
   - `--cap-drop ALL`
   - `--read-only` filesystem
3. **Consider gVisor** - Not currently available but recommended for production

## Container Security Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege**: Drop all capabilities not explicitly needed
3. **Network Isolation**: Use `--network none` when possible
4. **Resource Limits**: Always set memory and CPU limits
5. **Read-Only Root**: Use `--read-only` with explicit tmpfs mounts
6. **No New Privileges**: Always use `--security-opt no-new-privileges`
7. **User Namespaces**: Run as non-root user (use `--user`)

## About This Test

This security assessment simulates attacks that an AI model might attempt during evaluation:
- Container escape attempts
- Privilege escalation
- Network exfiltration
- Resource exhaustion
- Kernel exploitation
- Side-channel attacks

The goal is to ensure that even a highly capable AI system cannot break out of its evaluation sandbox.
