# METR Model Evaluation Platform

A robust, scalable platform for evaluating AI models for safety-critical capabilities, designed to demonstrate platform engineering competencies for METR.

## Architecture Overview

This platform demonstrates:
- **Containerized evaluation environments** for secure model testing
- **Kubernetes-native orchestration** for scalable evaluation runs
- **Safety-first evaluation framework** with monitoring and containment
- **Real-time monitoring dashboard** for evaluation progress
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing and deployment

## Key Features

### 1. Evaluation Framework
- Sandboxed execution environments using Docker containers
- Resource limits and network isolation for safety
- Structured evaluation protocol with checkpoints
- Automatic result collection and analysis

### 2. Platform Infrastructure
- Kubernetes-based orchestration for parallel evaluations
- AWS-compatible deployment configuration
- Prometheus metrics and logging integration
- Automated scaling based on evaluation queue

### 3. Safety Mechanisms
- Capability monitoring and alerts
- Automatic shutdown on anomalous behavior
- Audit logging for all model interactions
- Network isolation and egress filtering

### 4. Developer Experience
- REST API for evaluation submission
- TypeScript/React dashboard for monitoring
- Python SDK for custom evaluations
- Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Material-UI
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Testing**: pytest, Jest, k6 for load testing

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run locally with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -k k8s/

# Run evaluation
python -m metr_eval.cli evaluate --model gpt-4 --suite autonomous-replication
```

## Security Considerations

This platform implements defense-in-depth security:
- Container isolation with gVisor/Firecracker
- Network policies for zero-trust architecture
- Encrypted communication between components
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Comprehensive audit logging
