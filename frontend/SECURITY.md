# Frontend Security Policy

## Dependency Management

### Regular Audits

- Run `npm audit` before every commit
- Fix critical/high vulnerabilities immediately
- Review moderate vulnerabilities weekly

### Update Strategy

- Use exact versions in package.json (via .npmrc)
- Update dependencies monthly
- Security patches applied immediately

## Development Security

### Environment Variables

- Never commit `.env.local`
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for public values
- API keys stay server-side only

### Input Validation

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use TypeScript types for validation
- Never trust client-side validation alone

### Content Security Policy

- Strict CSP headers in production
- No inline scripts or styles

## Build Security

### Docker Image

- Multi-stage builds
- Run as non-root user
- Minimal base image (alpine)
- No secrets in images

### CI/CD

- Dependency scanning in pipeline
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Container scanning

## Runtime Security

### API Communication

- All API calls over HTTPS in production
- CORS properly configured
- Authentication tokens in httpOnly cookies

### Error Handling

- Never expose stack traces to users
- Log errors server-side only
- Generic error messages to client
