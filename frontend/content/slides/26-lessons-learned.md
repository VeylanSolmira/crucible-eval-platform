## Lessons for the Industry

### On AI-Assisted Development

1. **Trust but Verify**: Every AI suggestion needs human review
2. **Architecture First**: Humans excel at system design
3. **Implementation Speed**: AI accelerates the coding phase
4. **Documentation**: AI helps maintain comprehensive docs

### On Security Engineering

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers, not single solutions
2. **Isolation First**: Assume breach, limit blast radius
3. **Observability**: Can't secure what you can't see
4. **Testing**: Security must be continuously validated

### On Platform Building

1. **Start Simple**: MVP teaches you the real problems
2. **Iterate Safely**: Each change maintains security invariants
3. **Component Design**: Modularity enables evolution
4. **Production Mindset**: Build for operations from day one
