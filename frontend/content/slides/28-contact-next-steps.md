## Contact & Next Steps

### Experience the Platform
```bash
# Via SSH tunnel (secure)
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>
# Browse to http://localhost:8080
```

### Join the Journey
- Review the code and architecture
- Try breaking the security (ethically!)
- Suggest improvements
- Share your thoughts on human-AI collaboration

### The Future
This isn't the end - it's the beginning of a new model for:
- Secure AI evaluation
- Human-AI pair programming  
- Rapid platform development
- Open security research

**Together, we're building the infrastructure for safe AI development.**
