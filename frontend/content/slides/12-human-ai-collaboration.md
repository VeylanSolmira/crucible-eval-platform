## The Human-AI Collaboration Story

### Code Ownership Distribution

```python
# Lines of code by origin:
ai_generated = 5847  # 73%
human_written = 1342  # 17%
collaborative = 812   # 10%

# Decision points:
ai_suggested = 89
human_verified = 89
human_rejected = 12  # Including monkey patch!
```

### Key Collaboration Moments

1. **The Monkey Patch Incident**
   - AI suggested monkey patching for tests
   - Failed due to import caching
   - Led to explicit dependency injection pattern

2. **The Circular Import Crisis**
   - Project reorganization created import loops
   - Human identified root cause
   - AI implemented the fix

3. **Security Architecture**
   - Human defined requirements
   - AI implemented patterns
   - Human verified with tests
