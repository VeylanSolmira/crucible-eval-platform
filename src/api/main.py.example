"""
EXAMPLE: How api-gateway could work as a standalone microservice

This file shows how to wrap the api-gateway in a REST API for
microservice deployment. Currently, this component is used directly 
by the monolithic platform.

To use this example:
1. Install dependencies: pip install fastapi uvicorn
2. Rename to main.py
3. Run: uvicorn main:app --reload
4. Access API at: http://localhost:8000/docs

Note: The monolithic platform (src/platform/) doesn't use this file.
