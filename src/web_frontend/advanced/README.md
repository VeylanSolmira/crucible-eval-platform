# Advanced Frontend

This folder is reserved for advanced frontend assets when the frontend is split into modules.

Future contents:
- `index.html` - Advanced HTML5 template
- `css/` - Modular CSS files
- `js/` - Modular JavaScript with modern features
- `assets/` - Images, fonts, etc.

Currently, all frontend implementations are in `../web_frontend.py`.
