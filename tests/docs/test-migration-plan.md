# Test Migration Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the migration of valuable test cases from legacy test structures to the current test framework.

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed Migrations

#### 1. Core Integration Tests
**Migrated from**: Custom test framework (TestResult class pattern)
**Migrated to**: `tests/integration/test_core_flows.py`
**Migration date**: Week 4
**Changes made**:
- Converted from custom TestResult class to pytest assertions
- Added proper pytest markers (@pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.api)
- Integrated with standard test fixtures (api_session)
- Added TODOs for known limitations (timeout enforcement, language support)

#### 2. Security Tests
**Original**: `tests/security_scanner.py` (adapted for current architecture)
**Current**: `tests/security/test_input_validation.py`
**Status**: Adapted and enhanced
**Coverage**:
- Input validation tests
- Payload size limits
- Invalid language handling
- Timeout boundary testing
- Null byte injection protection
- Unicode handling

#### 3. Load and Performance Tests
**Migrated to**: Multiple specialized test files
- `tests/integration/test_load.py` - Concurrent evaluation testing
- `tests/integration/test_resilience.py` - Service failure recovery
- `tests/benchmarks/test_evaluation_throughput.py` - Throughput benchmarking

#### 4. Priority Queue Tests
**Migrated from**: `scripts/test_priority_queue.py` and `scripts/test_priority_celery.py`
**Migrated to**: 
- `tests/integration/test_priority_queue.py` - API-level priority testing
- `tests/integration/test_priority_celery.py` - Direct Celery priority testing
**Migration date**: Week 4
**Changes made**:
- Added proper pytest fixtures and markers
- Integrated with test infrastructure
- Enhanced test coverage

### âœ… Completed Migrations (continued)

#### 5. Docker Event Tests
**Status**: Completed
**Location**: 
- `tests/integration/test_docker_event_diagnostics.py` - Diagnostic timing tests
- `tests/integration/test_fast_failing_containers.py` - Functional verification
**Purpose**: Verify Docker event race condition fixes
**Integration**: Both tests are included in `run_tests.py`

### ðŸ“‹ Identified for Future Migration

#### 6. End-to-End UI Tests
**Current state**: No automated UI tests
**Proposed location**: `tests/e2e/test_ui_flows.py`
**Priority**: Low (manual testing sufficient for demo)
**Would test**:
- Code submission through UI
- Real-time status updates
- Error display
- Code editor functionality

#### 7. Kubernetes Integration Tests
**Current state**: Not applicable (using Docker Compose)
**Future location**: `tests/integration/test_k8s_deployment.py`
**Timeline**: Post-Kubernetes migration
**Would test**:
- Pod scaling
- Service discovery
- Persistent volume claims
- Network policies

## Migration Principles

1. **Preserve test intent**: Maintain the original test's purpose while modernizing implementation
2. **Add proper markers**: Ensure all tests have appropriate pytest markers for filtering
3. **Use standard fixtures**: Leverage existing test infrastructure (api_session, redis_client, etc.)
4. **Document limitations**: Add TODOs for known issues or platform limitations
4. **Enhance coverage**: Add additional test cases where gaps are identified

## Test Organization Standards

### Markers
All migrated tests should include appropriate markers:
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.api` - Tests requiring API service
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Tests taking > 5 seconds
- `@pytest.mark.docker` - Tests requiring Docker
- See `pyproject.toml` for complete marker list

### File Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Isolated component tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Multi-service tests
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # Full workflow tests
â”œâ”€â”€ security/      # Security-focused tests
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/   # Load and benchmark tests
â””â”€â”€ benchmarks/    # Long-running performance measurements
```

## Deferred Test Migrations

Some test categories are intentionally deferred:

1. **Authentication/Authorization Tests**: Deferred until auth system is implemented
2. **Multi-tenant Tests**: Deferred until Kubernetes namespace isolation
3. **GPU Tests**: Deferred until GPU executor support is added
4. **Language-specific Tests**: Currently Python-only (see TODO: LANGUAGE-SUPPORT)

## Validation Checklist

For each migrated test:
- [ ] Original test functionality preserved
- [ ] Proper pytest markers added
- [ ] Integrated with test fixtures
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Test passes in CI/CD
- [ ] Coverage metrics maintained or improved

## Next Steps

1. âœ… All critical test migrations are complete for Week 4 demo
2. âœ… Test infrastructure is modernized with pytest
3. âœ… Comprehensive marker system implemented
4. âœ… Marker audit script created for ongoing maintenance

The test migration is effectively complete for the current platform state. Future migrations will align with new feature development (Kubernetes, additional languages, authentication).
