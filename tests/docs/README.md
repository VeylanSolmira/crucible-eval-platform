## Documents

### Test Planning & Strategy
- **TESTING_STRATEGY.md** - Overall testing strategy and philosophy
- **test-migration-plan.md** - Plan for migrating tests to Kubernetes architecture
- **STATUS_UPDATE_TEST_PLAN.md** - Status update testing plan

### Test Organization
- **TEST_CLASSIFICATION.md** - Classification of tests by type (black box, white box, grey box)
- **marker-audit-report.md** - Audit report of pytest markers usage
- **to-implement.md** - List of tests that need to be implemented

### Test Results
- **initial-kubernetes-test.md** - Initial test results after Kubernetes migration, documenting failures and issues that need to be addressed

## Key Insights

The initial Kubernetes test results show:
- Unit tests: 100% passing (91/91)
- Integration tests: Multiple failures due to service discovery and configuration changes
- Security tests: 100% passing (8/8) after fixing environment configuration
- E2E tests: Not yet implemented
- Performance & Benchmarks: Deferred until other tests pass

Critical issues identified:
1. Network and filesystem isolation not working in Kubernetes Jobs
2. Service discovery using Docker Compose names instead of Kubernetes services
3. Configuration mismatches between test expectations and Kubernetes setup
