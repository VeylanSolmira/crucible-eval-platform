# Example Terraform variables for Crucible Platform EC2 deployment
# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and fill in your values

# AWS Configuration
aws_region  = "us-west-2"
aws_profile = ""  # Leave empty to use default profile

# Network Security
# Find your IP: curl ifconfig.me
allowed_ssh_ip = "YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE/32"

# Instance Configuration
instance_type = "t2.micro"  # Free tier eligible

# SSH Key - Generate with: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/crucible-key
ssh_public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3... your-email@example.com"

# Deployment Method: Choose one

# Option 1: GitHub deployment (for public repos or with deploy keys)
deployment_method = "github"
github_repo       = "https://github.com/yourusername/crucible-platform.git"
github_branch     = "main"

# Option 2: S3 deployment (more secure for private code)
# deployment_method    = "s3"
# deployment_bucket    = "your-deployment-bucket"
# deployment_key       = "crucible-platform.tar.gz"

# Optional: Different instance types for different workloads
# instance_type = "t2.small"   # 2 GB RAM - Better for concurrent evals
# instance_type = "t2.medium"  # 4 GB RAM - Good for Docker/gVisor
# instance_type = "t3.large"   # 8 GB RAM - Production workloads
