Monitoring services for evaluation tracking.
These can evolve into full observability platforms.

NOTE: Currently monolithic by design. See docs/architecture/when-to-modularize.md

Future modularization structure:
- collectors/     # Metric collection (CPU, memory, GPU, custom)
- exporters/      # Export to monitoring systems (Prometheus, CloudWatch)
- aggregators/    # Metric aggregation and processing
- storage/        # Time-series data storage

TODO: Consider modularizing when:
- Adding Prometheus/Grafana integration
- Need specialized metric collectors
- Supporting multiple export formats
