Execution engines for code evaluation.
These can evolve into full sandboxing services.

NOTE: Currently monolithic by design. See docs/architecture/when-to-modularize.md
for criteria on when to split into separate modules.

TODO: Consider modularizing when:
- Adding 5th engine type (e.g., Firecracker)
- Any engine exceeds 200 lines
- Need engine-specific dependencies
