# Scripts

Utility scripts for the Crucible platform.

## Directory Structure

### `/migrations`
Scripts used for code reorganization and migration. These were used during the platform restructuring and can be deleted once the migration is stable.

### `/docs`
Scripts for documentation organization and generation.

### `/deployment` (future)
Deployment and infrastructure scripts.

## Root Level Scripts

Only essential, frequently-used scripts should remain at the project root:
- `setup-venv.sh` - Python virtual environment setup

## Usage

Most scripts are one-time use for migrations. Review before running.
