# Source Code Structure

This directory contains the Crucible Evaluation Platform source code.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd platform
python extreme_mvp_frontier_events.py --help
```

## Directory Structure

- `platform/` - The monolithic platform (current implementation)
- `execution-engine/` - Code execution components
- `event-bus/` - Event coordination system
- `security-scanner/` - Security testing framework
- `shared/` - Shared utilities and base classes
- `lambda/` - AWS Lambda functions
- `reference/` - Historical implementations
- `future-services/` - Services planned for future development

For detailed architecture documentation, see `/docs/architecture/`

# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural decisions and design documentation for the Crucible platform.

## Documents

### Platform Architecture
- [Source Code Structure](../../src/README.md) - Overview of `/src` directory
- [Event Bus Design](event-bus-design.md) - Event-driven architecture patterns
- [Microservice Scaffolding](microservice-scaffolding.md) - How components become services
- [Dockerfile Status](dockerfiles-status.md) - Current state of containerization

### Design Decisions
- [Component Architecture](../architectural-patterns-exploration.md) - TRACE-AI components
- [Security Architecture](../COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_GUIDE.md) - Multi-layer security
- [Evolution Summary](../evolution/abstraction-evolution-summary.md) - How we got here

### Migration Paths
- [Monolith to Microservices](microservice-scaffolding.md) - Future service separation
- [Real-time Updates Evolution](../evolution/real-time-updates-evolution.md) - Polling to WebSockets
- [Next Steps Roadmap](../next-steps-upgrade-roadmap.md) - Platform evolution

## Key Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Monolithic first, microservices when needed
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each component has a single responsibility  
3. **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling through events
4. **Security First**: Multiple isolation layers
5. **Migration Ready**: Clear path to scale

See the [5-Day METR Plan](../5-day-metr-submission-plan.md) for implementation timeline.
